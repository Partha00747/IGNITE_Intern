      <p>
        <b>Yamaha's R-Series of motorcycles today is led by the flagship YZF-R1 superbike</b>, with the lineup including the <i>YZF-R7, R3, R25, R15, and R125.</i> Every sportbike comprising the R-Series family is designed to offer riding excitement to motorcyclists across the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The start of it all was the release of the original YZF-R1 in 1998, the progenitor of the R-DNA that runs throughout the entire series. Ever since, the R-Series has constantly evolved and advanced in order to bring the excitement of riding a sportbike to users everywhere, regardless of where they live or what roads they ride. The R-Series is the most vivid reflection of Monozukuri based on Yamaha's Jin-Ki Kanno development philosophy, to treat the seductive exhilaration felt when one with the machine as a shared baseline when quantifying and integrating it into a Yamaha's performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        he R-Series has also remained one of the Yamaha brand's most iconic and recognizable creations. In the series' history, Yamaha has taken on a number of revolutionary technical challenges as well as bold styling and design challenges. Since its inception, the R-Series has been about tapping into and augmenting a rider's own capabilities and potential; you get lost in the fun and thrill of riding at your skill level so much that before you know it, you are already faster than you were before. That idea continues to drive the series today and will in the future as well.

            From the late-1980s through to the '90s, it was the age of the hefty supersport machine. Mounting powerful 1,000+ cc engines in equally sizable frames and bodywork, manufacturers competed for big-bike presence on the road and the highest top speed. In that sense, these motorcycles and how they were used were closer to today's sport-tourers; ample power and space in the saddle were the main criteria riders looked for. Yamaha's flagship entry in the category was the YZF1000R Thunderace, with the YZF600R Thundercat as its smaller sibling in the lineup.
